# [2.0.1]
## Fixed
- Fix bug when trying to copy multiple emojis. (#6)

# [2.0.0]
## Changed
- Download emoji list from https://unicode.org/emoji/charts-11.0/full-emoji-list.html instead of emojipedia, as that one didn't work at all anymore
- Skin color selection is now a second step after certain ("human") emojis. Only the neutral version is included in the main list, which accordingly is a lot smaller now.

## Added
- Downloading, parsing and extracting emoji properties from https://unicode.org/Public/emoji//11.0/emoji-data.txt so that we can find "human" emojis for skin color selection
- A changelog üòÅ
